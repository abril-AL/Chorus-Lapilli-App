# Chorus-Lapilli-App

Read chorus-lapilli for instrucitions on how to build the app, note:
need npm to use. Also, will find instructions on how to play the game.
Also has description on the implementation and overall structure. 

For the source code, go to App.js and App.css to see what I myself
added, the rest came from react and create-react-app.
